# this is an example of a Chef template.  It is a simple
# INI-style file.  The first section name is dynamically
# generated to be the current date in YYYY_MM_DD format
# and the second through fifth sections are generated in
# an 'each' loop.
#
# note that ending an ERB tag with -% instead of just %,
# that line doesn't produce an empty line in the output.
# Use this syntax on lines that are pure logic (like the
# require line and start and end of the loop) and contain
# no actual output

<% require 'date' -%>
[today_<%= DateTime.now.strftime('%Y_%M_%D') %>]
variable = value

<% %w(two three four five).each do |section_name| -%>
[<%= section_name %>]
<% 5.times do |i| -%>
variable_<%= i %>=value_<%= i %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
