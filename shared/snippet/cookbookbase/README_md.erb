## Development

The first time you check out this cookbook, run

    bundle --binstubs

to download and install the development tools.

## Testing

Three forms of cookbook testing are available:

### Style Checks

    bin/rake style

Will run foodcritic (cookbook style) and tailor (ruby style/syntax)
checks. These tests must pass before the cookbook can progress
through the CI pipeline.

### Unit Tests

    bin/rake spec

Will run ChefSpec tests.  It is a good idea to ensure that these
tests pass before committing changes to git.

#### Unit Test Coverage

    bin/rake coverage

Will run the ChefSpec tests and report on test coverage.  It is a
good idea to make sure that every Chef resource you declare is covered
by a unit test.

#### Automated Testing with Guard

    bin/guard

Will run foodcritic, tailor, rubocop (if enabled) and chefspec tests
automatically when the associated files change.  If a chefspec test
fails, it will drop you into a pry session in the context of the
failure to explore the state of the run.

To disable the pry-rescue behavior, define the environment variable
DISABLE_PRY_RESCUE before running guard:

    DISABLE_PRY_RESCUE=1 bin/guard

### Integration Tests

    bin/rake kitchen:all

Will run the test kitchen integration tests.  These tests use Vagrant
and Virtualbox, which must be installed for the tests to execute.

After converging in a virtual machine, ServerSpec tests are executed.
This skeleton comes with a very basic ServerSpec test; refer to
http://serverspec.org for detail on how to create tests.
